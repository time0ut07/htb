# Hack-the-Box (HTB)

This repo will be where I store self-crafted Proof of Concept (PoC) Script for boxes that I have done. Majority of these scripts already exists but I want to craft my own to learn more. Some of the scripts might just be an automated task for me for specific box exploit.


Note: All my writeups are in my notion so no writeup here 

I'm a beginner
